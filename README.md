App to help Cornell students find apartments

#Link(s) to any other public GitHub repo(s) of your app. If you have one repo for iOS and one for Backend, please link to your backend repo in your iOS README, and your iOS repo in your backend README.

We weren't able to successfully integrate the API with iOS, so there are unfortunately no screenshots - the app wouldn't show any content because that requires integration with backend.

Description: With so many websites available to find apartments to rent in Ithaca, the process is unnecessarily complicated. We've compiled all of that data into one app to make it easier for users to find apartments to rent.

Backend requirements:
Main View has list of apartments, can click on apartments to get more information, also has info on Landlords
API using Databases, Deployed on Google Cloud
