App to help Cornell students find apartments

https://github.com/dylancastillo/hack-challenge-ios

We weren't able to successfully integrate the API with iOS, so there are unfortunately no screenshots - the app wouldn't show any content because that requires integration with backend.

Description: With so many websites available to find apartments to rent in Ithaca, the process is unnecessarily complicated. We've compiled all of that data into one app to make it easier for users to find apartments to rent.

Backend requirements:
Main View has list of apartments, can click on apartments to get more information, also has info on Landlords
API using Databases, Deployed on Google Cloud
